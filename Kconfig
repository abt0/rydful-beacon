config BEACON_DIAGNOSTICS
	bool "Enable beacon diagnostics"
	default n
	help
	  Enable LIS3DH diagnostic checks on startup.
	  This will verify the accelerometer is working correctly
	  by reading WHO_AM_I register and testing data fetch.

config BEACON_CALIBRATION
	bool "Enable motion calibration mode"
	default n
	help
	  Enable calibration logging to tune motion detection thresholds.
	  When enabled, logs delta_sq, variance, and magnitude values
	  for every sample. Use this to find optimal threshold values
	  for your specific motion patterns.

	  Steps to calibrate:
	  1. Enable this option and rebuild
	  2. Place device at rest - note values (noise floor)
	  3. Simulate motion - note values (motion signature)
	  4. Set MOTION_THRESHOLD_MS2_SQ between noise and motion
	  5. Set VARIANCE_THRESHOLD between noise and motion
	  6. Disable this option for production
